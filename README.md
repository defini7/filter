# Filter
## It's filter on C
Filter means that you can use 4 different filters on pictures. **This programm support only .bmp files!**
And there are filters:
  - grayscale.
  - blur.
  - sepia.
  - reflect.
I made it in web IDE and Makefile can't be supported for example in Visual Studio, you need to edit Makefile
to start this programm in your IDE.
